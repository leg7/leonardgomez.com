		<h1>How to setup taskwarrior 3.0 sync</h1>
		<h4>Written: 2025-07-13, Last Updated: N/A</h4>
		<hr>

		<p>
			It took me a while to figure out how to setup this thing because
			there is almost no documentation on how to do it and the
			configuration options are very misleading to say the least, so here
			is a little tutorial on how to task syncing on taskwarrior 3.0.
		</p>

		<h2>Install the taskchampion service on your server</h2>
		<p>
			There are many ways to sync your tasks but the only one that didn't
			seem to be horrible was taskchampion. If you want to learn more
			about other ways to do this you can read the manual page with the
			command <code>man task-sync</code>.
			<br><br>
			I'm using NixOS so this was pretty trivial for me. I made the
			service accessible through a reverse proxy with nginx.
			If you don't know what NixOS is you can just ignore this part and
			find a wiki page on how to setup taskchampion on your distro.

			<code-block>
				<span slot="filename">System flake excerpt</span>
				<span slot="content">
services = {
  taskchampion-sync-server = {
    enable = true;
    allowClientIds = [
      "85038910-8fe2-480d-b6cb-6e7fabc1fa44" # Personal
    ];
  };
  nginx = {
    enable = true;
    package = pkgs.nginxStable.override { openssl = pkgs.libressl; };
    recommendedProxySettings = true;
    recommendedTlsSettings = true;

    virtualHosts."taskchampion.${domain}" = {
      addSSL = true;
      enableACME = true;
      locations."/" = {
    	proxyPass = "http://127.0.0.1:${toString config.services.taskchampion-sync-server.port}";
      };
    };
  };
};
				</span>
			</code-block>

			We'll talk about what <code>allowedClientIds</code> means later.
		</p>

		<h2>Setting up your taskrc</h2>
		<p>
			Once we have the sync server up and running we need to configure
			the clients that will connect to it. For example I had to configure
			my laptop and desktop.
		</p>

		<h3>Knowing where your data is</h3>
		<p>
			By default taskwarrior will be an asshole and create the taskrc at
			<code>~/.taskrc</code>, cluttering your home and giving you another
			problem to deal with in your life, which you never should have had
			to deal with in the first place.
			<br><br>

			Thankfully you can move it to <code>~/.config/task/taskrc</code>
			without the usual 1-2 combo follow up problem of having to export
			global vars like
			<code>TASK_CONFIG_HOME="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task/taskrc"</code> and
			<code>TASK_DATA_HOME="$XDG_DATA HOME/task"</code>.
			<br><br>

			Instead it goes for the unconventional approach of defining those
			dreaded global vars in the config file directly like so:

			<code-block>
				<span slot="filename">~/.config/task/taskrc excerpt</span>
				<span slot="content">
data.location=~/.local/share/task
hooks.location=~/.config/task/hooks
				</span>
			</code-block>

			Anyways, venting aside, this is important because you will most
			likely need to know where you task database is for the next part.
			Taskwarrior stores tasks in an sqlite database, which is a file.
			Even if you're not planning to sync your tasks you should know where
			your database so that you can easily back it up, and easily not
			delete it by accident like me when reinstalling your system 🥲.
		</p>

		<h3>Setting up sync</h3>
		<p>
			Next you have to configure the sync settings. Let me explain the non obvious settings.
			<br><br>

			<code>client_id</code>, unlike it's name indicates, is not unique
			id for your device at all. It's a unique id for the task database
			you are syncing, a better name for it would be
			<code>database_id</code>.<br> This means you should set this to the
			same id on all the devices you intend to sync the database too. You
			can use the <code>uuidgen</code> command for this.
			<br><br>

			<code>encryption_secret</code> is the key used to encrypt the
			database when sending it over the network. Don't share this with
			anyone. You can generate it with whatever you want, I just used
			bitwarden. I don't know what kind of encryption it's using so I
			went with a long key just in case.

			<code-block>
				<span slot="filename">~/.config/task/taskrc excerpt</span>
				<span slot="content">
sync.server.url=https:\/\/taskchampion.leonardgomez.com
sync.server.client_id=85038910-8fe2-480d-b6cb-6e7fabc1fa44
sync.encryption_secret=4JQ!m3Irm8K1QvV^ATQVw0QEvCkbLX994hjoxQ&F1#jWleaiJ^hAA@%JV#ejk9Rdf39tCqnVbjZ8NF7@p9lz$T8Ni@QjxhvNwxG3kGqq*!ugRHe$a%C!FEaRS6T93Eku
				</span>
			</code-block>
		</p>

		<h2>Syncing your tasks</h2>
		<p>
			Once you have setup your taskrc with the same sync settings on all
			your devices you can sync the database by running <code>task
			sync</code> on your devices.
			<br><br>

			If you are successfully syncing your database with no error
			messages but the tasks aren't syncing, you've probably already
			synced your database with bad settings previously. I made the same
			mistake because I thought client_id was a unique id to identify
			your devices and I synced my db with those different ids. To fix
			this I suggest backing up your database and then running <code>task
			export > test && task import test</code> to clear the sync
			metadata. After this syncing should work correctly again.
